## Signature
  
The signature formalises the process of describing our function's inputs and outputs. Taking the 
'DNA' example above, we might write:

`compute_gc: String -> Float`

Here, `compute_gc` is the name we choose to give our funtion. Following the name, we describe a single input, of type `String`. The arrow points to the output data, of type `Float`.

## Purpose

This one sounds deceptively easy: in one sentence (say, 80 characters max), describe what your function does.

> Purpose statement guidelines:
> * Avoid repeating the word problem. It likely contains extra 'tasks' that you're function *doesn't* actually do.
> * Don't repeat info that is in the signature. There is no need for the name of the function, or a description
> of its inputs and outputs.
> * Keep it as generic as possible. If it calculates the area of a rectangle, say it calculates the area of a rectangle. Don't say, it gives the area of a Boorowa field plot. 
> * Try and word it so any colleague in Agriculture and Food would understand it.

Let's return again to our field data example:

'The field data is back from the trial, but unfortunately I'm having a lot of trouble loading it into the software because the assistant recorded the dates using the month's name, and it wants dates formatted like 2018-03-02, 2018-06-04, etc. Do you think you could write me a quick script to help me out?'

We've already defined our signature:

`convert_date: String String String -> String`

(note the clarity already given by the signature).

A purpose statement might be:

**"Makes the date format yyyy-mm-dd from separate day, month, and year observations"**

> ## DNA purpose statement
> 
> Which of the following is the best purpose statement for our DNA example?
>
> 1. Takes a string of DNA characters and returns the GC percentage as a float.
> 2. Calculates how many bases are in a DNA sequence, then calculates how many GC bases are in the same sequence, then divides the GC by the DNA to find the ratio.
> 3. Calculates the average GC content of a DNA sequence.
> 4. Calculates the proportions of (G + C) in any given string.

> Given your word problem and signature, write a purpose statement for the antibiotic exercise:
>
> 'Antibiotics are sometimes tested by 'dropping' a measured dose onto the middle of a petri dish that is
> covered in a bacterial 'lawn'. Resistance is measured as the area of the disk still covered by bacteria
> after 2 days. Bacterial death spreads out from the antibiotic drop creating a perfect bacteria-free central
> disk. You've recorded the diameter of several hundreds of test spots, with three replicates per plate. Find
> the average measure of resistance.'

## Stub

Here, we sketch out our actual function, giving names to the input and output data. This is a lot like our
signature, however here we start to use proper Python 3 notation: 

Starting from the Field Trial signature, `convert_date: String String String -> String`, the 'logic' of 
our stub becomes `convert_date: Day Month Year -> Date`.

In Python function definition notation, we write:
~~~
def convert_date(day, month, year):
    #function body	
    return(date)
~~~
{: .language-python}

To keep our design process all together, let's add in the signature and purpose statement:
~~~
#convert_date: String String String -> String
def convert_date(day, month, year):
    """Makes the date format yyyy-mm-dd from separate day, month, and year observations"""
    #function body
    return(date)
~~~
{: .language-python}
